# watir_cucumber_automation
This is just a very simple QA automation framework that I created using watir/cucumber/rspec and of course ruby as the programming language.

Just download the code, install ruby and the included Gems in the Gemfile. Then you're all set, ready to run the automated feature file.

The webdriver is part of the repo (within support folder), so no need to worry about adding to the PATH variable. That is being handled from Ruby.

Too simple I know, but at least gives an idea on how this stack merges together.

Oh! last thing, page object model was used as well. Any feedback is well received. :-)
